# Lectures

- This course is organized as a **journal club**.
- Reading and presentation of recent machine learning research papers.
- Every week, one of us will:
    - select a research paper,
    - introduce the necessary background,
    - present the paper,
    - discuss and criticize its content.
- Goal: training for research and development in machine learning.
